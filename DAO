Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO) is a form of legal structure with no central executives or governing body that allows its members vote for or against a prposal that is aimed at improving the quality of service or security the project seeks to deploy or enjoy.
DAO allows tge participatipation of all its members in decision making irrespective of how much tokens the member has, for as long as it is either added to liquidity pool or staked. 
To belong to a DAO in this context, one has to be a holder of the token, the project has deployed through its smartcontracts or have adopted through partnership. A member sometimes can be required to add liquidity or stake in order to be eligible for votes on proposals.
The amount of holdings, or liquidity added or staked often times determines the number of votes each member gets to give on a proppsal.
Members receive rewards whenever the proposal they voted for gets implemented. 
Some DAOs deploy tge use of Validators while others require that each user commits directly with no orovision for validators.
